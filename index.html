      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Hi, I'm Gaayathiri — a computer science graduate with a passion for building things with code. 
          While I've taken time to focus on my family, I've continued learning and exploring the world of web development.
          I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, and I enjoy creating clean, functional websites and applications.
          I'm now looking to grow as a software engineer by taking on real-world projects, collaborating with others, 
          and constantly improving my skills. Whether it's solving problems or bringing creative ideas to life through code,
          I'm excited about what's next on my journey in tech.
      </p>
